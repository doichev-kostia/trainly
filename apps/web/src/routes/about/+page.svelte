			Welcome to Trainly, the ultimate destination for all your train travel needs. Founded in 2023, Trainly began

			started when John Doe, a passionate traveler, found themselves frustrated by the complexities and
			inefficiencies of booking train tickets. This experience sparked an idea - to create a seamless,
			user-friendly platform that would make train travel accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
